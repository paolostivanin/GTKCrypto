* Encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256, Twofish-256, Serpent-256, Camellia-256, CAST-128 or Blowfish-128 using either CBC or CTR mode;
* Encrypt and decrypt text using one of the aforementioned algorithms;
* Compute hashes of a chosen file (MD5, GOST94, SHA1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512 and Whirlpool);

This software is developed by Paolo "Polslinux" Stivanin (https://paolostivanin.com)


Security
--------
* Encrypt-then-MAC. The plain text is encrypted and then the MAC of the encrypted text is computed and appended to the cipher text.
* Confidentiality is given by AES/Twofish/Serpent/Camellia/CAST5/Blowfish;
* Integrity is given by the MAC calculation (MAC = HMAC+SHA512);
* The input key is derived using PBKDF2 with 100'000 iterations and using SHA512 as hash algo;
* The key is temporarly stored inside a portion of secure memory which is erased before the program exits;


Requirements
------------
* GCC or Clang: *suggested* version of Clang *>= 3.6*, of GCC *>= 4.9.0*;
* Gcrypt: **required** version **>=1.7**;
* GTK+: **required** version **>=3.18**, *suggested* version *3.22*;
* Glib: **required** version **>=2.46**, *suggested* version *2.50*;


How to compile
--------------
* `git clone https://github.com/paolostivanin/GTKCrypto.git`
* `cd GTKCrypto`
* `mkdir build && cd build`
* `cmake ../ && make`


How can I trust your program?
----------------------------
Don't trust me, trust the code. But if you really want to be sure I'm not doing things in the wrong way, than just encrypt a file using GTKCrypto and write your own decrypt program.
This is a relatively quick and easy task to achieve, just be sure to first understand the structure of the encrypted file (spoiler: `enc_file = metadata + encrypted_data + HMAC`). More info [HERE](https://github.com/paolostivanin/GTKCrypto/blob/master/src/crypt-common.h).
